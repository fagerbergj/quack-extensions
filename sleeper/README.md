# sleeper

Sleeper fantasy-football extension for quack. The client slice (issue #93) shipped the OpenAPI
spec, generated client, recorded fixtures, and a cached wrapper. This slice adds the extension
UI (see `~/workspace/wt/sleeper-requirements.md` for the full extension design) - tools/skills
land separately.

## UI

`sleeper/ui.go` mounts a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS page (embedded from `sleeper/ui/static/`, no build
step) on the authed router at `GET /sleeper/`, plus four JSON routes:

- `GET /sleeper/api/seasons?league_id=` - the season chain (walks `previous_league_id`,
  tolerating a gap deeper in history instead of erroring the whole list), each with this
  league's record for the configured `default_user`.
- `GET /sleeper/api/season?league_id=` - one season's live league facts, "me"/opponent (from
  rosters + the current week's matchups), standings, recent moves, and reserve-slot count -
  built from the cached Sleeper client, never from job artifacts.
- `GET /sleeper/api/artifacts?league_id=&stop=` - every job artifact for that stop
  (`draft`, a week number, or `review`), season notes, and per-partner trade talks, each read
  via `Host.ReadArtifact` by its `ext:sleeper:<league>:<stop>:<job>` chat id. Until a job has
  run, its card is `found: false`; behind `extensions.sleeper.fixture: true` a miss instead
  serves the reference example JSON under `sleeper/ui/fixtures/`, marked `example: true`.
- `POST /sleeper/api/jobs` `{league_id, stop, job, args}` - calls `Host.Dispatch` with that same
  chat id (a repeat call appends a turn) and returns the chat link.

Artifact JSON schemas live in `sleeper/ui/schemas/*.json` (one per job: lineup, waivers, trade,
digest, trends, retro, draft, history, season-notes) - the renderer in `sleeper/ui/static/
render.js` reads exactly those shapes. `sleeper/ui/fixtures/*.json` are schema-conformant
examples derived from the approved prototype's data (`~/workspace/wt/sleeper-ui-ref/`).

### Storybook

`sleeper/ui/storybook/` is a standalone `@storybook/html-vite` project (pinned exact versions;
`npm install` then `npm run storybook` for `-p 6011`, `npm run build-storybook`). Stories live in
`stories/*.stories.js`, one per card plus `FullPage`, each with `Default`/`Dark`/
`MobileViewport390` variants, fed from `sleeper/ui/fixtures/`. `npm run render-check` builds
Storybook and screenshots every story at 390/1280 width, light/dark, with Playwright, failing on
a console error or horizontal overflow; CI runs it as the `sleeper-storybook` job.

## Plugin

`plugin/` is the Sleeper plugin quack loads through its plugin registry: `plugin.json`, the seven
job agents under `agents/` (card, prompt, rubric, and `agent.yaml` with tools, skills, and model
role), the skills under `skills/`, and the ten workflow shapes under `workflows/`. quack seeds it as
`github:fagerbergj/quack-extensions@sleeper/vX.Y.Z#sleeper/plugin`, a registry row named `sleeper`,
and seeds its agents and workflows only while `extensions.sleeper` is configured.

`plugin_test.go` checks that every tool an `agent.yaml` names is one of this module's tools or a
quack builtin from its allowlist, that each agent ships a prompt, a rubric and a `sleeper:` skill,
that each card's artifact kind has a schema in `ArtifactSchemas`, and that each skill's
`references/*schema*.json` is byte-identical to the `ui/schemas/<kind>.json` quack validates the
agent's write against. Edit the ui schema and copy it over the reference. `tools/quack-compat.sh`
seeds `plugin/` into quack, fails unless every agent and workflow in `plugin.json` seeds, and fails
when a non-`sleeper_` tool is missing from quack's builtin tool map.

One `sleeper/vX.Y.Z` tag releases both halves. quack pins the Go tools in `go.mod` and the plugin in
its `plugins.seed` entry, and both pins name the same tag. `plugin.json`'s `version` is that tag's
version; bump it in the PR that precedes the tag.

1. Merge the change and tag `sleeper/vX.Y.Z`.
2. In quack, bump `go.mod` and the `plugins.seed` ref to that tag in one PR. A deployment with its
   own `plugins.seed` bumps its entry to the same tag along with the image.
3. Restart. quack marks the rows `plugins.seed` creates as seeded, and at boot a seeded row whose
   seed entry changed moves to the new entry and is fetched at the new tag. A row last set over REST
   (`POST /api/v1/plugins`) belongs to the operator and does not follow the seed.

The first cutover needs no manual step either. Before the move, deployments seeded
`.agents/plugins/sleeper` as a local row. Upgrade quack to the release that fetches this plugin and
change the deployment's seed entry to the `github:` form: boot replaces the local row, since config
owns local rows, and fetches the plugin. Do not delete the row by hand.

A plugin-only change (prompt, skill, rubric, workflow) can go live before the next image: bump the
deployment's seed ref and restart. When the change touches Go tools, the image carrying the new
`go.mod` must ship with it, since a plugin agent naming a tool the binary lacks is dropped.

## Decision points

`decisions.go` declares four observe-only points (`sdk.DecisionPoints`) for a paired shadow A/B of
the weekly calls, scored later against real points. They are asked from `RunEnded` once a
`lineup`, `waivers` or `trade` run ends `done`: a goroutine reads the job's artifact through
`Host.ReadArtifact` (the same chat id and artifact name the UI reads) and calls `Host.Decide` one
point at a time, each call capped at 10s. Nothing waits on it, and no answer, error or timeout
changes an artifact or a dispatch. quack namespaces each as `ext:sleeper/<name>`.

| Point | Question (primary) | Asked per | Baseline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lineup_change` | `swap` (noul): should the proposed player start in this slot instead of the current one? | lineup starter row with `replaces` | `true` |
| `waiver_pickup` | `pickup` (noul): is this add worth its drop and the priority or FAAB? | `candidates` row; `also_checked` row | `true`; `false` |
| `waiver_priority` | `priority` (score, levels `0`-`4`: fifth or later ... first claim) | ranked `candidates` row, when 2+ are ranked | `5 - min(rank, 5)`: rank 1 is `4` |
| `trade_accept` | `accept` (noul): should this trade happen exactly as written, from my side? | `offers` row | `true` for `send`; `false` for `decline` and `counter` |

No point is restrictive. Option sets are static, as the declaration requires, so start/sit is
asked per recommended swap rather than as a choice over player ids, and lineup has no negatives.

The state carries the evidence without the answer: no `verdict`, `replaces`, `confidence` or
`rank`, and the lineup state names the two players `current` and `proposed` instead of starter and
bench. Each player row is `{id, name, pos, team, opp, status, practice, proj, floor, ceiling,
recent, reasoning}`: `reasoning` is the analyst's `why` for that row, `opp` is joined from the
schedule only for the live regular-season week, and `recent` is up to three prior weeks of
`pts_ppr` from the week stats, weeks with no stat line left out. A `why` that names the pick in
prose (for example "only runs if claim 2 fails") still reaches the state. The trade state carries
the offer's `give`/`get` rows, `delta`, `why` and who offered it, not the full rosters.

Join keys, all in the state: `chat_id`, `league_id`, `season`, `week` (the stop's week; a trade
uses the live NFL week) and

- `lineup_change`: `slot`, `current.id`, `proposed.id`. Score with the league's own
  `Matchups(league, week)` `players_points`: the swap was right when `proposed` outscored
  `current`.
- `waiver_pickup` / `waiver_priority`: `add.id`, plus `drop_id` when the drop text resolves to
  exactly one player through the name index, else the raw `drop` text. Score the add's weekly
  points (`WeekStats` `pts_ppr`, or `players_points` once rostered) for weeks after `week` against
  the drop's.
- `trade_accept`: `partner_id`, `offer_index`, `give[].id`, `get[].id`; score rest-of-season
  points from `week` on.

A re-run of a job re-asks every row of its latest artifact, so the scorer keeps one decision per
key (the latest). Enable them in quack's `decisions.points` as
`"ext:sleeper/<name>": {enabled: true, handler: <handler>, mode: observe}`.

## The spec is the source of truth

Sleeper publishes no OpenAPI or Swagger document. `openapi.yaml` is owned by this module,
written from endpoints probed live on 2026-09-18 and response shapes derived from real
recorded data - not from Sleeper's prose docs. Paths marked `x-undocumented: true` were found
by probing (not in Sleeper's own docs) and may disappear without notice; treat a 404 from one
of those as expected, not a bug.

The generated client lives in `sleepergen/` (`go generate ./sleeper/...`, config
`sleepergen/genconfig.yaml`, pinned to `oapi-codegen/v2@v2.7.0` - the same version and pattern
quack uses for its Langfuse client in `internal/langfuse`). Client + models only, no server:
this module only ever calls out to `api.sleeper.app`.

Contract tests (`contract_test.go`) decode every fixture in `testdata/get/` into its generated
type with unknown fields disallowed - an extra or renamed field fails the test instead of a
404/400 in prod. Missing-field drift needs a second check: `DisallowUnknownFields` doesn't
catch a field that just disappears (it decodes to a zero value, silently), so `openapi.yaml`
marks the fields tools depend on `required`, and the same test also asserts every fixture
instance carries those keys, read straight from `openapi.yaml` (not a hardcoded copy) so the
spec stays the source of truth. `TestMutationDroppedRequiredFieldFails` proves the check
actually fires. `TestAllFixturesCovered` fails if a fixture has no case exercising it, so a
stale recording can't rot unnoticed.

## Fixtures

Recorded from the live API for two leagues in owner jffagerberg's (user_id
860211057418018816) chain:

- **Current season**: league `1356407594683482112` (2026, week 2) - league settings, rosters,
  users, matchups for weeks 1-2, transactions for weeks 1-2, both playoff brackets, traded
  picks, the league's drafts, one draft with its picks, NFL state, trending add/drop, one
  player, the players dump, week-2 projections and stats, one team's depth chart, the season
  schedule, week-2 scores (kickoff instants and venues), player research, and one player's
  season stats.
- **Past season**: league `1257102049204514816` (2025, complete) - league settings, rosters,
  winners bracket, matchups for weeks 1 and 14, transactions for weeks 1 and 5 (week 5 has two
  real trades - the only trade shape verified against live data; this league runs with
  `settings.pick_trading: 0`, so `Transaction.draft_picks` and both `traded_picks` endpoints
  are always `[]` and `TradedPick`'s field shape is unverified in both leagues), and its draft
  (`1257102049204514817`, all 140 picks) with its traded picks - recorded for the
  league-history job's `Chain` walk (`previous_league_id`), which the current league's chain
  reaches in one hop (a second hop exists live but isn't fixtured; `Chain` errors rather than
  silently truncating when it hits that gap - see `client.go`).

**Trimmed, not full dumps** (large upstream payloads, kept small deliberately):

- Players dump (`/v1/players/nfl`, ~14 MB live): trimmed to the union of every player_id
  referenced by the other fixtures - both leagues' rosters/starters, matchups, draft picks,
  transactions (adds/drops), trending add/drop, and the depth-chart sample (312 entries,
  including every DEF unit those fixtures cite). `TestPlayersDumpCoversReferencedIDs`
  (`client_test.go`) re-derives that reference set from the fixtures at test time and fails if
  the dump falls behind it again.
- Week-2 projections: trimmed to the current league's 143 rostered player_ids plus the top 30
  unrostered free agents by `pts_ppr` projection (173 entries). Week-2 stats: the live
  endpoint itself only carried 141 players total this early in the week (most hadn't accrued
  a stat line yet); intersected with the same keep-set, 11 remain.
- 2025 season stats: trimmed to the 140 players drafted in the past league.
- Week-2 scores: each game's `metadata` trimmed to `date_time`, `status`, `stadium_details`,
  `home_team`, and `away_team` (the live response also carries ~60 odds, forecast, and
  live-score keys).

Every other fixture is the live response as-is (all under 60 KB).

## Re-recording

```bash
cd sleeper
go run ./cmd/qa-mock --fixtures testdata/get --addr :8092 --record &
curl http://localhost:8092/v1/league/1356407594683482112   # any path from openapi.yaml
kill %1
```

`--record` proxies a fixture miss to the real `https://api.sleeper.app` and saves the
response under `testdata/get/<hash>.json`, keyed the same way `github/cmd/qa-mock` keys GitHub
fixtures: `sha256("GET_" + path [+ "_" + query])[:8 bytes hex] + ".json"`. Re-recording the
players dump, week-2 projections/stats, or the 2025 season stats will pull the full untrimmed
payload back down - re-run the trim script in this PR's history (or re-derive: filter to
rostered/drafted player_ids plus top free agents by `pts_ppr`) before committing. Re-recording
week-2 scores likewise needs its `metadata` trimmed back to the five keys listed above.

`cmd/qa-mock` with no `--record` flag (there is no `serve` subcommand - just the one binary and
flags above) replays only what's already recorded and 404s on a miss, so CI and
`client_test.go` never touch the real API.

## Client

`client.go` wraps the generated client with an in-memory cache (per-endpoint TTLs: state 5m,
league/rosters/users 10m, matchups and schedule 2m, players dump 24h, projections/stats 1h,
week scores 6h) and a player name index (lowercased "first last", last name, and DEF team codes
-> player_ids), built from whatever `PlayersDump` last fetched. `WeekScores` (the undocumented
`/scores/nfl/regular/{season}/{week}`) is read only for each game's kickoff (`start_time`) and
stadium; `weekSlate` (`tools_league.go`) joins it to the schedule on `game_id` and computes
`locked` from kickoff vs. now on every call, so no TTL delays a lock. A `flex-schedule` game's
`start_time` is a placeholder and is reported as `kickoff_tbd`; postponed and canceled games get
no kickoff. `Chain` walks a league's `previous_league_id` back through past seasons (newest
first, bounded to 10 seasons, cached 24h) for the league-history job.

`sleeper_schedule` returns that slate. `sleeper_roster`, `sleeper_matchup`, and `sleeper_player`
attach each player's own game from it by NFL team code (a DEF's player_id is its team), or
`bye`/`no_game_reason`, and only for the live regular-season week: the players dump holds
today's teams, so a past week is never joined. A schedule failure degrades to
`no_game_reason: "schedule unavailable"` instead of failing the tool. Reserve and taxi players
carry no game.

`kickoff_local` and `fetched_at_local` render in quack's configured zone (`Host.Location`), else
the process zone. The optional `timezone` config (an IANA name such as `America/Chicago`)
overrides quack's zone for this extension, and a tool's `tz` argument overrides both. All three
accept only region-style names (or `UTC`): `EST`/`CDT` load as fixed offsets that are an hour off
in DST. A bad `timezone` fails startup, a bad quack zone is ignored with a warning (process zone),
and a bad `tz` falls back with a `tz_note`. `time/tzdata` is embedded so zones resolve in images
without a zone database.

`NewClient(baseURL, httpClient)` takes an explicit base URL so tests (and later, tools) point
at `cmd/qa-mock` instead of the real API. Sleeper answers an unknown id with HTTP 200 and a
literal `null` body rather than a 404; `okJSON` treats that the same as a real not-found error
instead of returning a zero-valued struct with no error.
