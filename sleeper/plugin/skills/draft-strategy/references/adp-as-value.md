# ADP as a value signal

Source: `research-r9-drafting.md` §1, "ADP as a value signal".

## The verdict is code-owned

`sleeper_draft` computes `adp_delta` (pick_no minus adp) and `adp_verdict`
(`value`/`reach`/`fair`, at an 8-pick band) per pick. That verdict is the
steal/reach call for a report card - state it as given, never recompute it
by hand from `pick_no` and `adp`. Everything below is background on *why*
an 8-pick fall or reach matters, not a competing threshold to apply.

## Definition

"The average spot where a player is being taken across thousands of
real drafts... the market's consensus *price*" - descriptive, not
prescriptive, not a projection ([NovaPredict, Jun 13, 2026](https://novapredict.com/blog/fantasy-football-adp-values-and-reaches)).
"If you take players exactly at their ADP, you pay sticker price for
everything and gain nothing on the room" (same source).

## The reach test: VONA

Value-Over-Next-Available: if the player will still be available at the
next pick, his VONA is zero - reaching is not an edge
([FantasyPros support docs, updated Mar 30, 2020](https://support.fantasypros.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005868747-What-is-value-based-drafting-What-do-player-draft-values-mean-VORP-VONA-VOLS-VBD)).
Plain-language version: "Can I get the player I want at my next pick? If
the answer isn't confidently 'yes,' then it's not a reach" ([FantasyPros, May 2019, snippet-only](https://www.fantasypros.com/2019/05/when-is-it-okay-to-reach-on-draft-day-fantasy-football/)).

## Fallen-player window

A player 8+ picks past ADP is a value window - but "most ADP falls are
inattention, not information"; check for an explainable cause (injury,
depth-chart regression, narrative cooling) before treating a fall as
value ([Fantasy Strategy Guide, undated](https://fantasystrategyguide.com/adp-strategy)).

## Published reach thresholds (content-farm framing, treat as defaults not gospel)

**>15 picks ahead of ADP** only with a stated positional-structural
argument; **5-15 picks ahead** = "normal reach zone"; **within ±4** =
market rate ([Fantasy Strategy Guide, undated](https://fantasystrategyguide.com/adp-strategy)).
Stricter published version: "Never pay more than one tier above ADP for
anyone. If you must reach, reach small" ([NovaPredict, Jun 13, 2026](https://novapredict.com/blog/fantasy-football-adp-values-and-reaches)).

## Format-mismatch failure mode

"In 10-team leagues, ADP data from 12-team leagues systematically
misprices positions because roster construction logic changes when 24
fewer roster spots are available league-wide" ([Draft Value Analytics, undated](https://draftvalueanalytics.com/adp-analysis/)).
Never treat a 12-team, non-PPR, or other-platform ADP as this league's
price. Current 10-team PPR spine (143 human mocks, Sep 11-18, 2026):
first QB Allen 25.5, first TE McBride 28.9, first DEF 82.6, first K
120.9 ([Fantasy Football Calculator](https://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp/ppr/10-team/all)).

## Staleness

ADP moves 25-40 picks in the final weeks and is a lagging indicator -
any advice must carry a snapshot timestamp ([Draft Value Analytics, undated](https://draftvalueanalytics.com/adp-analysis/); [Footballguys, Jul 13, 2017](https://www.footballguys.com/article/HarstadADP)).

## Disagreement: follow the market vs. the market is wrong

Harstad: doing average decisions by ideal ADP across a million leagues
yields a winning record - "the single best strategy" - while conceding
collective reaching is net negative ([Footballguys, Jul 13, 2017](https://www.footballguys.com/article/HarstadADP)).
The Athletic / NFL Spin Zone counter: ADP lags last season's results and
following it costs you. Reconciliation both converge on: ADP is a
timing/price signal checked against an independent value board, never
the draft order itself.
