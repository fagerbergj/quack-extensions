# FAAB bidding

FAAB leagues only. Source: `research-r2-waivers.md` §1.1-1.2.

## Mechanics

Fixed season-long budget ($100 default); bids submitted blind; highest bid wins, deducted from that manager's remaining budget; claims execute in value-ranked order; $0 bids are legal and win ties on lower waiver rank
([Sleeper Support, Aug 25, 2024](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/9657110-how-do-faab-and-waivers-work)).

`waiver_position` still exists in a FAAB league, but only as the tiebreaker when two bids match — it is never a separate resource to spend alongside FAAB.

## Reading the competition

`sleeper_roster(roster_id=...)` (roster ids from `sleeper_standings`) returns every other team's `faab_left`. A team with little budget remaining can't realistically win a big bid regardless of need; a team flush with FAAB and thin at the position is the real competition for a top target. Size a bid against who else in *this* league can plausibly outbid you, not the global trending count.

## Bid bands by need tier (share of remaining FAAB)

| Need tier | Band | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Season-changing replacement (lead RB job, WR1/QB1 out) | 25-40% | [Calculator Collection, Aug 10, 2026](https://www.calculatorcollection.org/en/articles/faab-waiver-wire-strategy/) |
| Mid-tier flex/role player/bye fill | 5-15% | same |
| Lottery ticket (handcuff, deep sleeper) | 1-3% | same |
| Third-string RB needing an injury to see the field | ≤15% | [4for4, Aug 28, 2026](https://www.4for4.com/2026/preseason/ultimate-guide-winning-waiver-wire-2026) |
| Kicker | $1 or nothing, always | same |
| Defense | never more than $2, no exceptions | same; [Fantasy Upside](https://fantasyupside.com/learn/how-faab-bidding-works) |
| The one season-defining bid (a legitimate every-week starter) | 40-60% without flinching, once a season | [4for4, Aug 28, 2026](https://www.4for4.com/2026/preseason/ultimate-guide-winning-waiver-wire-2026) |

Only bid >15% of remaining budget when (a) a multi-week starter injury has a clear 15+ carry/volume path for the backup, (b) the player is positionally scarce, or (c) it's the fantasy-playoff stretch (weeks 14-16)
([Fantasy Strategy Guide, flagged secondary](https://fantasystrategyguide.com/faab-bidding-strategy)).

## Pre-bid gate: the "three Ps"

For any bid over 10% of starting budget — **P**ath (real route to volume, or does it need a second injury?), **P**ermanence (rental vs. job), **P**rice (is the premium over the likely second bid sensible?). Fail one P, halve
the bid; fail two, walk away ([4for4, Aug 28, 2026](https://www.4for4.com/2026/preseason/ultimate-guide-winning-waiver-wire-2026)).

Anchor the bid to your own upgrade over your current starter, not the market: worked example, an 8 PPR-point/week upgrade × 12 remaining weeks =
96 fantasy points, "worth a big bid" ([Fantasy Upside](https://fantasyupside.com/learn/how-faab-bidding-works)).

## Auction mechanics

Bidders cluster on round numbers — a $11/$26/$51-style odd bid wins a shocking number of auctions outright for one extra dollar over that cluster; ties fall back to waiver priority, so bidding odd is how you
*avoid* a tie rather than how you win one ([4for4, Aug 28, 2026](https://www.4for4.com/2026/preseason/ultimate-guide-winning-waiver-wire-2026)).
Game-theoretically, a first-price sealed-bid equilibrium shades bids to about (n-1)/n of true value — ~90% at 10 bidders ([Wikipedia, bid shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_shading)) — a theoretical anchor, not a number any mainstream fantasy source publishes directly.

## No published number

No single by-week-of-season spending model is agreed (see the waivers SKILL.md's "No published number" section for the four-plus-one stances). State which published stance is being applied.
