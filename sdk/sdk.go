// Package sdk is the quack extension API. It is self-contained: it must
// never import github.com/fagerbergj/quack, so an extension written against
// it can never accidentally depend on quack internals. quack imports this
// package (and each extension package) - never the reverse.
//
// Design principles that shape every type below:
//   - Dispatch-time shaping only: DispatchRequest is the entire surface an
//     extension has to influence a run. There are no agent-loop hooks -
//     enforcement stays gate-owned inside quack.
//   - Ownership test for strings: a field stays a plain string only if
//     quack-core never interprets it, only passes it through or matches it
//     opaquely. A string quack-core parses, branches on, or must keep in
//     sync with the extension becomes a named type (DeliveryKind, RunStatus)
//     so a typo is a compile error, not silent behavior loss.
//   - RunObserver is observation-only: it never blocks or mutates a run,
//     and fires only after the run's outcome is final.
//   - Factories must be side-effect free: validate config and construct,
//     nothing more - they also run in contexts that never serve, such as
//     config checks. Background resources belong in Start/Stop.
